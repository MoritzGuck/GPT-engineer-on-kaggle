The Tool wear [min] column is the tool wear in minutes. The Machine failure column is the target. It is either 0 or 1. The TWF column is the tool wear failure. The HDF column is the heat dissipation failure. The PWF column is the power failure. The OSF column is the overstrain failure. The RNF column is the random failures.
