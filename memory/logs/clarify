The Tool wear [min] column is the tool wear in minutes. The Machine failure column is the target. It is either 0 or 1. The TWF column is the tool wear failure. The HDF column is the heat dissipation failure. The PWF column is the power failure. The OSF column is the overstrain failure. The RNF column is the random failures.

The specific task of the machine learning project is to predict the probability of machine failure for a given set of features.\n2. The f1_score is used to evaluate the performance of the model, indicating the balance between precision and recall.\n3. There are no specific requirements or constraints mentioned for the machine learning model, so we can assume that any suitable model from the scikit-learn library can be used.\n4. The columns TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, and RNF represent different types of failures in the machine, but their specific meanings and significance are not provided. We can assume that these columns contain binary values (0 or 1) indicating the presence or absence of each type of failure.\n5.
