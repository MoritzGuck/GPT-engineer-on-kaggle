# GPT-engineer-on-kaggle
Testing the capabilities of GPT-engineer with GPT 3.5 Turbo to solve a kaggle machine learning competition.

## What is GPT-engineer?

The GPT-engineer package is a GPT-based tool to generate a complete codebase for a software project just by using specifications in human langauge. More info here: [GPT-engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer). 

## How was GPT-engineer used in this project?

The project is organized into two branches. One with the original output from GPT-engineer (`GPT-engineer-output`) and one with the output after some manual refactoring (`human-adapted-output`). 

The prompt for our project can be found in the file `prompt`. After kicking off a job, GPT-engineer asks clarification questions. I adapted the prompt-file 3 times upon clarification questions from GPT-engineer. 

The logs from the clarification questions and the engineered prompts from the GPT-engineer tool can be found in the `memory/logs` folder.

## The code base

The codebase is found in the `workspace` folder. The file `all_output.txt` contains explanations from GPT-engineer on why it generated the code it did.

The folders `data`and the other files are not generated by GPT-engineer. 
The original output of GPT-engineer did not execute at all. To see the other changes, compare the two branches.
