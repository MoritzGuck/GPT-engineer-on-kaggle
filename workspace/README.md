Based on the requirements and assumptions, the following core classes, functions, and methods will be necessary:

1. `DataLoader` class: Responsible for loading and preprocessing the training and test data.
   - `load_data()` method: Loads the training and test data from CSV files.
   - `preprocess_data()` method: Performs any necessary preprocessing steps on the data.

2. `ModelTrainer` class: Responsible for training the machine learning model.
   - `train_model()` method: Trains the model using the training data.

3. `ModelEvaluator` class: Responsible for evaluating the performance of the trained model.
   - `evaluate_model()` method: Evaluates the model using the test data and calculates the f1_score.

4. `ModelPredictor` class: Responsible for making predictions using the trained model.
   - `predict()` method: Generates predictions for the test data.

5. `SubmissionWriter` class: Responsible for generating the sample_submission.csv file.
   - `write_submission()` method: Writes the predicted probabilities to the sample_submission.csv file.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

**1. data_loader.py**

This file contains the `DataLoader` class responsible for loading and preprocessing the data.
